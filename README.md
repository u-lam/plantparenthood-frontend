### Intro
  Houseplants are awesome!! They are decorative, require little attention, and can even help purify the air around you. But what happens when you have to make a sudden move and can’t bring all your plants with you? Or when you downsize? Or if you just want to switch it up with different types of plants? 

  ***Plant Parenthood*** is the place for that! Donate or trade your plant babies here!
